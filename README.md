Got it! Here's the updated `README.md` reflecting that the API is written in PHP:

# React Expense Tracker

A React-based expense tracker application that allows users to manage and monitor their daily expenses. The application features login functionality, an interactive dashboard with budget summaries and charts, and the ability to add, update, and delete expenses. The app also provides a visual representation of monthly and yearly budget data through charts.

## Features

- **Login**: Users can log in using their credentials to access their dashboard.
- **Dashboard**: 
  - Displays monthly, yearly, and total expense data.
  - Budget and expense charts (Bar chart for budget, Pie chart for expenses).
  - Provides the option to create budgets.
- **Expense Management**: 
  - Add, edit, and delete expenses.
  - Expenses are categorized (e.g., Food, Medicine, Transport, etc.).
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Blueprint.js**: A UI toolkit for building web interfaces with modern design patterns.
- **Font Awesome**: For icon usage (e.g., lock, user).
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Fetch API**: For handling HTTP requests and interacting with the backend.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different views (Login, Dashboard, etc.).
- **PHP**: Backend API for handling user authentication, budget management, and expense operations.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user data, expenses, and budgets.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd expense-tracker
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the backend API:
   - Ensure you have a PHP environment set up (e.g., using Apache and MySQL).
   - Place the PHP files in the appropriate directory (e.g., `/var/www/html/expense`).
   - Set up the MySQL database with the necessary tables (`users`, `expenses`, `budgets`, etc.).
   - Configure the backend to run on `http://localhost/expense`.

5. Start the development server for the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Login**: Enter your username and password to log in. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to your dashboard.
2. **Dashboard**:
   - View your monthly and yearly expenses and budget data.
   - Create and manage your budget from the dashboard.
   - View charts and graphical representations of your budget and expenses.
3. **Expenses**:
   - Add a new expense by filling in the required fields (amount, category, description, and date).
   - Edit or delete existing expenses.
   - The application uses editable fields for easy updating of expenses.

## API Endpoints

The app communicates with a PHP backend for user authentication, and budget and expense management. The server URL is `http://localhost/expense`.

- **Login**: `POST /expense/login.php` - Authenticates a user with a username and password.
- **Expense Operations**:
  - `PUT /expense/{user_id}.php`: Adds, updates, or deletes expenses for the given user.
  - Data is sent as a JSON object with `type` (add, update, or delete) and `data` (expense details).

## Example Expense Object

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "amount": 500,
  "category": "Food",
  "description": "Lunch",
  "date": "2025-01-29"
}
```
